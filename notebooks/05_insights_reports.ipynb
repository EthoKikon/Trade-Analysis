    "- **Statistically significant PnL differences by sentiment**  \n",
    "  ANOVA (F = 9.06, p = 2.6 × 10⁻⁷) confirms that at least two of the five Fear/Greed categories have different mean trade profits.\n",

    "- **Extreme Greed vs. Extreme Fear gap**  \n",
    "  Tukey HSD shows trades on **Extreme Greed** days outperform those on **Extreme Fear** days by an average of \\$33.36 (p = 0.0002).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Win‑rate lift under greed**  \n",
    "  Traders win ~37 % of the time in **Extreme Fear** but ~46 % in **Extreme Greed**, a nine‑point increase in successful trades.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Sentiment‑Aware Sizing:** increase position size on days with sentiment > 80.  \n",
    "2. **Trader‑Specific Tilt:** combine account historical win‑rate with market sentiment to prioritize high‑odds trades.  \n",
    "3. **Monitor Regime Shifts:** track rolling correlation—if it turns negative, dial back sentiment‑based allocation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- Integrate live price volatility indicators  \n",
    "- Build an interactive dashboard (Power BI or Streamlit)  \n",
